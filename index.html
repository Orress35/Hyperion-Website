    <h1>What is RS?</h1>
    <p>RS is a programming language with 5 main branches: RSU, RSL, RSF, RSS and RSM.</p>

    <h1>Which branch should you choose?</h1>
    <h2>General Use - RSU:</h2>
    <p>
        RSU is a fast procedural programming language with C-like syntax.
        It can be used on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS),
        supports all assembly instructions and most C++ libraries and
        executes at the same speed as pure C.
    </p>
    <h2>Machine Learning and Algorithms - RSL:</h2>
    <p>
        RSL is a scripting language based on Python.
        It supports C-like syntax, variable type declarations and has a few automatic optimizations
        to make your Python code faster. Sadly, as of right now, RSL has roughly the same performance
        as pure Python, so I wouldn't recommend using it until the first stable version comes out.
    </p>
    <h2>Mathematics and Data Analysis - RSF:</h2>
    <p>
        RSF is a functional programming language.
    </p>
    <h2>Mobile Development - RSM:</h2>
    <p>
        RSM is a object-oriented language based on Java.
        This branch is currently in early development and I'm planning to fully migrate it from Java to C++ on
        release, which means that the current description for it will be completely invalid in a few months.

<div>
    <h1>RS for Object-oriented programming</h1>
    <p>
        All RS branches support object-oriented programming. However, it's heavily discouraged as it can lead to
        performance drops, high memory usage and other issues.
