                <abbr title="Reflection Script">RS</abbr>
                is a programming language with 5 main branches:
                RSU, RSL, RSF, RSS and RSM.

            <br>
            <h2>
                General Use - RSU:
            </h2>
            <p>
                RSU is a low-level procedural programming language with C-like syntax. <br>
                It can be used on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS),
                supports all assembly instructions,
                supports most C and C++ libraries,
                has easy-to-use file, math and GUI modules
                and executes at the same speed as pure C.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Machine Learning and Algorithms - RSL:
            </h2>
            <p>
                RSL is a high-level scripting language based on Python. <br>
                It supports C-like syntax, variable type declarations and has a few automatic optimizations to make your Python
                code faster. Sadly, as of right now, RSL has roughly the same performance as pure Python, so I wouldn't recommend
                using it until the first stable version comes out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Mathematics and Data Analysis - RSF:
            </h2>
            <p>
                RSF is a low-level functional language. <br>
                
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Mobile Development - RSM:
            </h2>
            <p>
                RSM is a high-level object-oriented language based on Java. <br>
                This branch is currently in early development and I'm planning to fully migrate it from Java to C++ on release,
                which means that the current description for it will be completely invalid in a few months.

            <h1>RS For Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
            <p>
                All RS branches support object-oriented programming. However, it's heavily discouraged as it can lead
                to performance drops, high memory usage and other issues.
