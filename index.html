    <h1>What is RS?</h1>
    <p>RS is a fast and flexible procedural programming language created in September 2020. Most of its syntax comes from C++, Go, JavaScript and Rust, however, there are lots of unique features which are not present in any of the major programming languages. </p>

    <h1>Why RS?</h1>
    <h2>• Speed</h2>
    <p>
        RS is faster than all major programming languages including C, C++ and Java, which makes it perfect for any performance-heavy task.
    </p>
    <h2>• Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
        RS is suitable for almost any environment: <br>
        Desktop Development - Windows, Linux and MacOS, <br>
        Mobile Development - Android, <br>
        Cyber Security - encryption, hashing, penetration testing, <br>
        Game Development - Unity, Godot, Unreal and custom engines, <br>
        Operating Systems - UEFI support <br>
        and much more.
    </p>
    <h2>• Language Level</h2>
    <p>
        While RS is a higher-level language, you can still <br>
        1. Directly access the virtual memory <br>
        2. Call assembly instructions or have whole functions written in pure assembly <br>
        3. Access the CPU registers <br>
        4. Directly call interrupts or syscalls <br>
        5. Directly access devices
    </p>
